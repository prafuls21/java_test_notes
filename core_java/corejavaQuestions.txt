Lately, I have been revisiting core concepts in Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices through technical discussions and interviews. I’ve compiled a list of frequently asked topics to help others preparing for similar roles!

🔹 Most Expected Questions:
1️⃣ What’s in your resume – Be ready to explain every project, skill, and experience you’ve listed.
2️⃣ How does your experience align with the job requirements – Focus on showcasing relevant skills and how you can contribute to the company’s goals.

🔹 Java & Core Concepts:
✔️ Java 8 Features: Stream API (map, flatMap, filter), Lambda Expressions, Functional Interfaces & types
✔️ Optional Class, Default & Static Methods in Interfaces
✔️ Comparable vs Comparator – Coding Questions
✔️ Exception Handling & Best Practices
✔️ Java Collections: Internal working of Map, HashSet, and Default Implementations of hashCode() & equals()

🔹 Spring Boot & Microservices:
✔️ Key Spring Boot Annotations: @SpringBootApplication, @Controller, @RestController, @Qualifier vs @Primary, @Transactional, @Transient
✔️ Global Exception Handling: @ControllerAdvice and RestController Advice
✔️ Lombok Annotations: @Data, @Builder, @Value, etc.
✔️ Spring Validation: @Valid, @Validated, Custom Validation
✔️ @PathVariable vs @RequestParam
✔️ PUT vs PATCH – Key Differences & Use Cases, PUT vs POST
✔️ Dependency Injection (DI): Constructor, Setter, and Field Injection
✔️ Bean Scopes: singleton, prototype
✔️ JPA & Hibernate: Configuration, Custom Queries
✔️ Microservices Architecture: Monolithic vs Microservices, Service Discovery & Registry (Eureka, Consul)
✔️ Microservice Communication: Synchronous vs Asynchronous (REST, gRPC, Message Brokers)
✔️ Security: JWT Authentication, OAuth2, Spring Security
✔️ API Gateway, Circuit Breaker Pattern, SAGA Design Pattern (Choreography & Orchestration)
✔️ Docker, Kubernetes

🔹 Java Advanced Concepts:
🔸 Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy
🔸 Fail-Fast vs Fail-Safe Iterators
🔸 Java Multithreading: Callable vs Runnable, Locks, volatile, synchronized
🔸 Heap Memory vs Stack Memory
🔸 Singleton Class & Design Patterns
🔸 SOLID Principles & Best Practices
🔸 Serialization & Deserialization
🔸 Clonable Interface & Object Cloning

These topics frequently come up in interviews, and I hope they help others preparing for Java/Spring Boot roles. If you've encountered any interesting or unique interview questions !  🚀
